# Fix Backlinks

This branch aims to fix backlinks and forward links so they also work for `link({id})` notation.

Tests pass, but their are no tests for rhai backlinks and forward links (as rhai syntax is still being developed). It doesn't seem to be working either, even though the logic has been implemented since the new branch.

Forward Links has not yet been implemented.
